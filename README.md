# grades_from_bs_to_fast

Takes csv export from Brightspace and calculates final grade, and then saves to format FAST will accept.  Note that the grades that I record on brightspace are recorded as "being out of" what the piece of assessment is worth to the final grade i.e. not percentages. For experiments and assignments the best n count towards their final grade.  I do not have any required content, so all grades below 50 are coded F (you would need to modify to deal with N's)
